Tensorflow Linear Model

Task: 
Given census data about a person such as age, gender, education and occupation, we will try to predict whether or not the person earns more than 50,000 dollars a year. We will train a logistic regression model, and given an individual's information our model will output a number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability that the individual has an annual income of over 50,000 dollars.

Data:
The dataset we'll be using is the Census Income Dataset. The dataset comprise of features like age, gender, workclass, education, occupation, native country and income bracket. Out of these features some are Categorical and some are Continuous.
